## See What Your Week Actually Looked Like

> You ask: "Give me the recap of my week"

The MCP server returns hydrated time entries with project, workspace, client, tag, and running-timer context. Your client can turn that into a readable recap:

> 32.7 hours across 31 entries and 7 projects. Monday was a light planning day, Tuesday had the long implementation block, Wednesday stayed focused on one project, and Friday turned into a shipping run. The top project took 27% of the week, with two smaller projects close behind.

The server does not hard-code this prose or chart. It exposes structured Toggl data in a shape that makes synthesis easy.

## Catch the Drift

> You ask: "Did I actually work on what I said I worked on for that PR review entry?"

`toggl_get_timeline` can compare a tracked entry boundary with Toggl Track Desktop activity:

> The entry ran 1h 33m. About 67 minutes were in review tools, 5 minutes were scattered across chat apps, and the rest was idle or trimmed timeline space. The entry mostly checks out.

This is useful before invoicing, after long context-switching days, or whenever a vague entry like "admin" starts hiding too much Slack and browser time.

## See Patterns Over Time

> You ask: "Show me last month at a glance"

Daily and weekly report tools make it straightforward for the client to render heatmaps, spot streaks, and surface intensity changes:

![Monthly heatmap](docs/images/monthly-heatmap.svg)

Toggl is still the source of truth. The MCP layer makes the data easier for an agent to inspect, summarize, and visualize.

## Things You Can Ask

```text
What am I currently tracking?
How much time did I spend on the website project this month?
Start a timer for "PR review" on the Platform project
Show me yesterday's hours as a chart
What apps did I use most today?
Generate a daily report for last Friday
Compare this week to last week by project
Which day this month had the most billable work?
```

Chart prompts depend on your MCP client. The server returns the structured data; clients such as Claude decide how to render it.

## What Makes This Useful

**Hydrated responses**: time entries are enriched with `project_name`, `client_name`, `workspace_name`, `tag_names`, and normalized running-timer fields so the client does not need a second lookup for ordinary reporting.

**Smart caching**: workspaces, projects, clients, tasks, and tags are cached after first read. `toggl_cache_stats` shows hits, misses, loaded entities, and hit rate.

**Desktop activity timeline**: `toggl_get_timeline` summarizes app usage from Toggl Track Desktop and can return raw events when you need sequence analysis.

**Privacy controls**: timeline window titles are redacted by default. Use `include_events: false` for summary-only output, or opt into original titles with `title_mode: "raw"` when you explicitly need them.

**Period shortcuts**: `today`, `yesterday`, `week`, `lastWeek`, `month`, and `lastMonth` are supported on the tools where those periods make sense.

**Recoverable errors**: workspace resolution errors include `available_workspaces`, and Toggl quota/rate-limit errors include structured retry hints.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js `^20.19.0` or `>=22.12.0`
- A Toggl Track account
- Your Toggl API token from [track.toggl.com/profile](https://track.toggl.com/profile)

### Claude Desktop

Add this to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-toggl": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@verygoodplugins/mcp-toggl@latest"],
      "env": {
        "TOGGL_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here",
        "TOGGL_DEFAULT_WORKSPACE_ID": "123456"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`TOGGL_DEFAULT_WORKSPACE_ID` is optional. If you have exactly one Toggl workspace, the server can resolve it automatically. If you have multiple workspaces and do not set a default, workspace-scoped tools return the available workspace IDs so the client can retry with `workspace_id`.

Restart Claude Desktop, then ask:

```text
What am I currently tracking?
```

### Global Install

npm install -g @verygoodplugins/mcp-toggl

## Timeline Privacy

Toggl Track Desktop activity can include window titles. Those titles may contain document names, email subjects, chat text, URLs, OAuth pages, or database names.

By default, `toggl_get_timeline` returns raw event sequence and timing with titles removed:

```json
{
  "period": "today"
}
```

Summary-only mode returns app totals without raw events:

```json
{
  "period": "today",
  "include_events": false
}
```

Original window titles are opt-in:

```json
{
  "period": "today",
  "title_mode": "raw",
  "limit": 50
}
```

`redact_titles` is still accepted for older clients, but `title_mode` is the preferred API.
This is an intentional privacy-first behavior change from older releases: clients that need original window titles must pass `title_mode: "raw"` or `redact_titles: false`.

When in doubt, use `include_events: false`.

## Self-Hosting

mcp-toggl can run as a local stdio server or as a per-user Streamable HTTP server. For the full platform-agnostic guide, see [VGP MCP self-hosting](https://github.com/verygoodplugins/mcp-ecosystem/blob/main/docs/SELF_HOSTING.md).

Use a server-side Toggl token. Do not put your Toggl API token in the connector URL.
Remote HTTP deployments also require an MCP bearer token so the public `/mcp` endpoint cannot be used as a proxy for your Toggl account.

### Docker

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e TOGGL_API_TOKEN=xxx \
  -e MCP_HTTP_AUTH_TOKEN=change-this-random-secret \
  ghcr.io/verygoodplugins/mcp-toggl:stable
```

The container defaults to `TRANSPORT=http` and exposes:

- `POST /mcp` for Streamable HTTP MCP clients
- `GET /health` for platform health checks

Claude Desktop custom connector URL:

```text
https://your-deployment.example.com/mcp
```

Configure the connector to send `Authorization: Bearer <MCP_HTTP_AUTH_TOKEN>`.

### Railway

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.com/deploy/mcp-toggl?referralCode=VuFE6g&utm_medium=integration&utm_source=github&utm_campaign=generic)

Set `TOGGL_API_TOKEN` and `MCP_HTTP_AUTH_TOKEN` in Railway variables. Leave `TRANSPORT=http`; Railway will provide `PORT`.

### Other Hosts

Fly, Render, Coolify, and a bare VPS all use the same image and env vars. Required deployment secrets are `TOGGL_API_TOKEN` and `MCP_HTTP_AUTH_TOKEN`; `TOGGL_DEFAULT_WORKSPACE_ID` is optional for accounts with multiple workspaces.

## Caveats

**Toggl rate limits and quotas**: Toggl may return rate-limit or quota errors during chatty sessions. The server returns structured retry information when Toggl provides it. Warm the cache before large reporting sessions to avoid repeated project/client/tag fetches.

**Running timer duration**: Toggl uses negative duration values for running entries. Read `running` and `elapsed_seconds` from the hydrated response instead.

**Timeline availability**: `toggl_get_timeline` requires Toggl Track Desktop timeline sync. If it is not enabled or has not uploaded data yet, the tool returns `enabled: false` with setup guidance.

**Timeline totals**: `limit` only limits returned raw events. `summary`, `total_seconds`, and `total_hours` are calculated from all matching events.
